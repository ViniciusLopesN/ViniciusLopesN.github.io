I’m a Ph.D. candidate in Software Engineering at UEM (Brazil) and a Visiting Scholar at NCSU, where I research software architecture optimization and system modernization. My background includes a Master’s in Mechanical Engineering from Unicamp, where I developed topology optimization methods for microchannel flows—an experience that shaped my analytical and problem-solving mindset.

I’ve also worked with full-stack development using TypeScript, React, and Node.js, and I use Python extensively in my research. I enjoy combining engineering thinking, hands-on development, and academic research to build practical and well-reasoned solutions.
